his repository contains Python scripts relevant to the Numerical Analysis course. The files focus on fundamental matrix operations
This repository is a fork of the Original Project https://github.com/lihiSabag/Numerical-Analysis-2023.git
## Included Files

inverse_matrix.py: Python script for calculating the inverse of a matrix.
gaussian_elimination.py: Python script for solving linear systems using Gaussian elimination.

The Main file handles the execution of the following operations on two square-sized matrices:
**Print Matrices:** Display the original two matrices.
**Sum of Matrices:** Calculate and display the sum of the two matrices.
**Matrix Product:** Compute and display the product of the two matrices.
